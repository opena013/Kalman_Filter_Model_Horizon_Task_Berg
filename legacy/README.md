# Social Media Task Model Fitting Pipeline

This project uses reinforcement learning and drift-diffusion models to simulate and fit human choice and response time data from a social mediaâ€“themed value learning task.

The modeling pipeline includes options for:
- Fitting models using PyDDM, VBA, or SPM toolboxes
- Simulating behavior from posterior or prior distributions
- Running model-free analyses on empirical or simulated data
